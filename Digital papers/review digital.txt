Chapter 5 
-Read p 42-43 in course notes
-Synchronous sequential circuit analysis
-Procedure:
-Go from the circuit and find the equations (output, state and input)
-Obtain state table based on equations, present state, input state, next state and output
-Two methods to find the next state: add flip flop input equations to the table or state equation
-Create state diagram
-Analyze the function
-Sequential circuit design
-Reverse procedure of analysis
-Words to diagram
-Diagram to state table
-Determine number of Flip flops needed
-Obtain FF input equation and output eqn
